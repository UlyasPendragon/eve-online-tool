## Project Overview

### What is EVE Nomad?

EVE Nomad is a modern, cross-platform mobile companion app for EVE Online designed to solve the critical problem of mobile app abandonment in the EVE ecosystem. Current mobile apps (Neocom II, Evanova, EVE Portal) suffer from poor maintenance, buggy performance, and outdated UX - leaving thousands of active EVE players without reliable mobile access to essential game management features.

**EVE Nomad provides:**

- Modern, polished user experience that respects players' time

### Problem We Solve

**Market Gap Identified:**
- Existing mobile apps are abandoned or poorly maintained
- Players frustrated with buggy, laggy, outdated interfaces
- No modern mobile app meeting current UX standards
- Mobile access is critical for active players managing multiple characters

**Our Solution:**
- Professional, modern UX design (following iOS/Android design guidelines)
- Reliable, well-maintained application with regular updates
- Freemium model ensuring sustainable long-term development
- CCP-compliant monetization (backend services, not ESI data)

### Technology Stack

- **Platform:** Cross-platform (iOS + Android)
- **Framework:** [React Native / Flutter - TBD]
- **Backend:** [Node.js/Python/Go - TBD]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis caching
- **API:** EVE Swagger Interface (ESI)
- **Authentication:** EVE SSO OAuth 2.0
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging

- Multi-character data consolidation
- Background job processing for alerts
- Server hosting, databases, and ongoing development

- Free tier demonstrates value before asking for payment
