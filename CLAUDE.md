## Project Management: Linear MCP Integration

This project uses **Linear** for development tracking via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). All development tasks, features, bugs, and project planning should be tracked through Linear.

### Linear Workspace

- **Workspace Name**: EVE Online Tool
- **Purpose**: Centralized project management for all EVE Online third-party tool development
- **Access**: https://linear.app

### Linear MCP Setup

The official Linear MCP server is configured for this project:
- **Server URL**: https://mcp.linear.app/sse
- **Transport**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Configuration**: `claude mcp add --transport sse linear https://mcp.linear.app/sse`
- **Status**: ‚úì Connected

### Using Linear MCP

Linear MCP provides AI-native access to Linear's project management capabilities:
- **Find & Query**: Search for issues, projects, teams, and users
- **Create Issues**: Create new tasks and bugs directly from Claude Code
- **Update Issues**: Modify existing issues, change status, assign, add labels
- **Project Management**: Create and manage projects
- **Comments**: Add comments and context to issues

### Best Practices

- Create Linear issues for all features before implementation
- Track bugs and technical debt in Linear
- Use Linear projects to organize work by product concept (EVE Nomad, Industrialist's Ledger, CEO's Dashboard)
- Reference Linear issue IDs in commit messages and pull requests
- Update issue status as work progresses

### Linear Issue Documentation Standard

When completing Linear issues, **ALWAYS** follow this two-step process:

#### Step 1: Add Completion Comment
Before marking as Done, add a comprehensive comment with:
- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence overview of what was accomplished
- **Files Created**: List with descriptions
- **Files Modified**: What changed and why
- **Key Decisions**: Important architectural or technical decisions with rationale
- **Testing**: Test results and verification steps
- **Quality Checks**: TypeScript, formatting, linting results
- **Next Steps**: (Optional) What depends on this work

#### Step 2: Update Issue Description
- Check off completed task items (turn `- [ ]` into `- [x]`)
- Add checkmarks to acceptance criteria (‚úÖ)
- Add "Implementation Notes" section if helpful for future reference

**Rationale**: Linear issues serve as permanent documentation of what was built, how it works, and what decisions were made - invaluable for project history and knowledge transfer.

### Documentation

- Linear MCP Docs: https://linear.app/docs/mcp
- Linear API: https://developers.linear.app/

## GitHub Workflow (MANDATORY)

All development work MUST follow the GitHub feature branch workflow. Direct commits to `main` are discouraged.

### Workflow Overview

```
Linear Issue ‚Üí Feature Branch ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Pull Request ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
```

### Before Starting ANY Issue

**1. Create Feature Branch Immediately**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/eve-XX-brief-description
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/eve-XX-name` - New features
- `fix/eve-XX-name` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/eve-XX-name` - Code refactoring
- `docs/eve-XX-name` - Documentation updates
- `test/eve-XX-name` - Test additions/fixes

Always include the Linear issue ID (EVE-XX) in the branch name.

**2. Add to Todo List**

Create a todo list item: "Create and push feature branch for EVE-XX"

### During Development

**3. Commit Frequently**

Commit after each logical unit of work (not just at the end):
- After implementing a feature component
- After fixing a bug
- After writing tests
- After updating documentation

**4. Use Conventional Commit Messages**

```bash
git commit -m "EVE-XX: Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- How it works

Closes EVE-XX

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- **Subject**: `EVE-XX: Brief imperative description` (50 chars max)
- **Body**: Detailed explanation with bullet points
- **Footer**: `Closes EVE-XX` (triggers Linear-GitHub integration)
- **Attribution**: Claude Code generation notice

**5. Run Quality Checks Before Each Commit**

```bash
# Backend
cd eve-nomad-backend
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test  # When tests exist

# Mobile
cd eve-nomad-mobile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format .
```

### After Completing Issue

**6. Push Feature Branch**

```bash
git push -u origin feature/eve-XX-description
```

**7. Create Pull Request**

```bash
gh pr create --title "EVE-XX: Brief title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Brief overview of changes

## Issues
Closes https://linear.app/eve-online-tool/issue/EVE-XX

## Changes
- List of major changes
- New files created
- Modified files

## Testing
How to test the changes

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
EOF
)"
```

**PR Title Format**: `EVE-XX: Brief description matching issue title`

**8. Update Linear Issue with PR Link**

The Linear-GitHub integration should automatically link the PR, but verify:
- PR appears in Linear issue activity feed
- Issue status updated if needed

**9. Update CLAUDE.md**

Add completed work to the "Completed Work" section with:
- Issue number and title
- Brief description of implementation
- Key files modified
- Links to PR and Linear issue

### Todo List Template for GitHub Workflow

For every Linear issue, add these to your todo list:

```
- [ ] Create feature branch (feature/eve-XX-description)
- [ ] Implement changes
- [ ] Run quality checks (typecheck, lint, format)
- [ ] Commit changes with Linear issue ID
- [ ] Push branch to GitHub
- [ ] Create Pull Request
- [ ] Update Linear issue with PR link
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with completed work
```

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Create feature branch BEFORE any code changes
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Reference Linear issue ID in ALL commits
- Run quality checks before pushing
- Write comprehensive PR descriptions
- Update Linear and CLAUDE.md after merge

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Commit directly to `main` branch
- Create PRs with uncommitted EVE-19 work mixed in
- Skip quality checks (typecheck, lint, format)
- Use vague commit messages ("fix stuff", "updates")
- Forget to update Linear or CLAUDE.md
- Batch multiple unrelated issues in one PR

### Handling Partial/Incomplete Work

If you have uncommitted work for Issue A but need to start Issue B:

**Option 1: Stash** (for very small changes)
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: EVE-A partial work"
git checkout -b feature/eve-B-description
# ... work on EVE-B ...
git checkout feature/eve-A-description
git stash pop
```

**Option 2: Commit to Feature Branch** (preferred)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/eve-A-description
git add <files for EVE-A>
git commit -m "WIP: EVE-A partial implementation (incomplete)"
git push -u origin feature/eve-A-description
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/eve-B-description
```

### Linear-GitHub Integration

The repository has Linear-GitHub two-way sync enabled:

**GitHub ‚Üí Linear:**
- Commits with `EVE-XX` in message appear in Linear issue activity
- PR creation/updates appear in Linear
- PR merge closes Linear issue (if commit has `Closes EVE-XX`)

**Linear ‚Üí GitHub:**
- Issue creation includes GitHub issue link
- Issue updates sync to GitHub (when applicable)

### Repository Configuration

- **Branch Protection**: `main` branch has protection rules
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions run on all PRs (lint, typecheck, test, security scan)
- **Linear Integration**: Two-way sync active
- **PR Template**: `.github/pull_request_template.md` provides structure

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "CI failing on my PR"
- **Solution**: Run quality checks locally first, fix errors before pushing

**Problem**: "Linear issue not linked to PR"
- **Solution**: Ensure commit message includes `Closes EVE-XX` or `Fixes EVE-XX`

**Problem**: "Accidentally committed to main"
- **Solution**:
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit, keep changes
  git checkout -b feature/eve-XX-description
  git commit -m "EVE-XX: ..."
  git push -u origin feature/eve-XX-description
  ```

**Problem**: "Need to switch issues mid-work"
- **Solution**: Use Option 2 above (commit WIP to feature branch)

- **References**: Each issue links back to relevant sections in `Docs/idea research.md`

## Key Concepts & Constraints

### CCP Developer License Agreement Compliance

All development MUST comply with CCP's strict policies:

- **Prohibited**: Charging real-world currency fees for direct access to ESI (EVE Swagger Interface) data or application features
- **Permitted**:
  - Voluntary donations (Patreon, GitHub Sponsors) without restricting access
  - Advertising revenue (e.g., Google AdSense)
  - In-game currency (ISK) fees for access or features
  - Charging for value-added services (server-side processing, historical data storage, complex analytics) rather than raw API data access

### Viable Monetization Model

The "Hybrid Freemium" model (exemplified by EVE Tycoon):
- Free tier provides universal access to core features and ESI data
- Paid tier unlocks advanced features requiring significant backend infrastructure
- Subscription fee justified as payment for backend services (data storage, processing, hosting) not for ESI data itself

## Product Development Opportunities

Three primary concepts identified in research:

### 1. EVE Nomad - Mobile Companion App
- Target: Active players needing mobile access to game management
- Pain point: Current mobile apps are buggy, abandoned, and poorly maintained
- Key features: Skill queue monitoring, EVE Mail, market orders, asset browser, industry/PI dashboard
- Monetization: $2-5/month subscription for premium features

### 2. The Industrialist's Ledger - Production Planner
- Target: Industrial players from solo producers to corp directors
- Pain point: Complex multi-stage production planning requires manual spreadsheets
- Key features: Multi-stage project planning, asset-aware sourcing, build vs. buy analysis, integrated logistics
- Monetization: $5-10/month for advanced workflow automation

### 3. The CEO's Dashboard - Corporation Management SaaS
- Target: Small to medium corp leadership (5-100 members)
- Pain point: Powerful tools (SeAT, Alliance Auth) require technical expertise to self-host
- Key features: Recruitment pipeline, activity monitoring, SRP management, doctrine tracking, Discord integration
- Monetization: Per-seat pricing (~$0.50/member/month)

**Environment Configuration:**
- `.env` file for local development
- `app.config.ts` injects vars via expo-constants
- Type-safe access through `src/utils/config.ts`

**Deep Linking:**
- Scheme: `eveapp://`
- OAuth callback: `eveapp://auth/callback`

**Development Server:**
- Expo Dev Server: `pnpm start`
- iOS Simulator: `pnpm ios`
- Android Emulator: `pnpm android`

**Detailed Documentation:**
- Project initialization: Complete (EVE-74, EVE-75, EVE-76)
- Next steps: React Query hooks (EVE-78), OAuth (EVE-80)

### UX Philosophy
- Polished, modern user experience is a premium marketable feature
- Many existing tools are functionally adequate but have poor UX
- Clean, fast, intuitive interface can justify subscription pricing
- Mobile apps should use cross-platform frameworks (React Native/Flutter)

## Community Engagement Strategy

### Essential Practices
- Announce projects early on r/Eve subreddit and official EVE forums
- Create dedicated Discord for beta testers and early adopters
- Actively solicit and incorporate community feedback
- Maintain public development roadmap (transparency builds trust)
- Apply for EVE Partner Program for legitimacy and visibility

### Marketing Approach
- Demonstrate value through problem-solving content
- Create tutorials, guides, and YouTube videos showing real gameplay use
- Partner with EVE content creators for reviews and exposure
- Focus on solving specific pain points, not generic features

## Claude Code Subagents

This project uses **6 strategic subagents** for specialized, high-value development tasks. All subagents are manually invoked to maintain control over token costs.

### Available Subagents

Located in `.claude/agents/`:

#### Phase 1: Security & Quality Gates
1. **security-auditor** (Opus) - Strict security analysis for auth, payments, sensitive data
2. **code-reviewer** (Sonnet) - Code quality, performance, best practices review

#### Phase 2: Domain Expertise
3. **esi-integration-expert** (Sonnet) - EVE ESI API integration specialist
4. **test-architect** (Sonnet) - Test strategy and generation

#### Phase 3: Optimization Specialists
5. **database-optimizer** (Sonnet) - Prisma schema and query optimization
6. **api-architect** (Sonnet) - REST API design and OpenAPI specs

### When to Use Subagents

**High-ROI Scenarios:**
- Security-critical changes (OAuth, payments, tokens) ‚Üí **security-auditor**
- Pre-merge code reviews ‚Üí **code-reviewer**
- New ESI endpoints or ESI issues ‚Üí **esi-integration-expert**
- Schema design or slow queries ‚Üí **database-optimizer**
- Test suite creation ‚Üí **test-architect**
- New API surface design ‚Üí **api-architect**

**Avoid for:**
- Routine refactoring (use main conversation)
- Simple bug fixes (use main conversation)
- Documentation writing (use main conversation)

### Invocation Examples

```
Use the security-auditor to review src/auth/esi.ts
Use the code-reviewer to review the wallet service
Use the esi-integration-expert to implement the skills endpoint
Use the database-optimizer to review the character schema
Use the test-architect to create tests for character.service.ts
Use the api-architect to design the wallet transaction API
```

### Token Economics

- **Per-invocation cost**: 8,000-25,000 tokens (3-4x multiplier)
- **Monthly estimate**: ~370,000 tokens (~$1.50-2.00/month)
- **ROI**: High (prevents issues costing more to fix later)

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Guide**: `SUBAGENTS.md` (usage, examples, best practices)
- **Integration Guide**: `Docs/subagent-integration-guide.md` (workflows, token costs)
- **Linear Issue**: EVE-63 (Subagents implementation)

### Best Practices

1. **Explicit invocation**: Always name the subagent explicitly
2. **Scope the task**: Provide clear, bounded scope (specific files/directories)
3. **One at a time**: Don't chain multiple subagents in one request
4. **Read reports carefully**: Implement critical issues immediately
5. **Track costs**: Monitor token usage, use sparingly on large codebases

## Development Philosophy

### Launch Strategy
- Start with Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solving 1-2 core pain points
- Implement freemium model from day one
- Collect real-world feedback before feature expansion
- Avoid feature creep before initial launch

### Sustainability Focus
- Subscription revenue must cover operational costs and developer time
- Prevent burnout that has killed many EVE tools
- Sustainable business = long-term support promise to users
- Community trusts tools with visible, ongoing maintenance

### Competitive Positioning
- Do NOT attempt to replace entrenched free tools (Pyfa, DOTLAN, zKillboard)
- Focus on underserved niches or workflow integration
- Build tools that complement/integrate with existing ecosystem
- Specialize rather than generalize

## Key EVE Ecosystem Tools (Context)

Players heavily rely on these established free tools:
- **zKillboard**: Central PvP combat database, community standard for kill/loss tracking
- **Pyfa**: Offline ship fitting and theorycrafting, gold standard despite in-game alternatives
- **DOTLAN**: Strategic navigation and sovereignty mapping
- **EVE Tycoon**: Successful freemium market/industry profit tracker (monetization template)

## Market Pain Points to Address

High-priority player frustrations identified:
1. Mobile app abandonment and poor quality
2. Complex industrial production chain management ("spreadsheet problem")
3. Tedious Planetary Interaction multi-character management
4. Fragmented workflow requiring dozens of browser tabs
5. Technical barriers to corporation management tools
6. Difficulty finding content for solo/small group players
